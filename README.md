# clara-ns-ex

An example of using clara-rules and defining facts, rules, and queries in different namespaces.  Uses records that have definitions.

Meant as a personal example of where I build up a personal set of clara-rules examples to get a feel for the package.  Referencing:

- http://www.clara-rules.org/
- https://github.com/cerner/clara-examples

## Usage

Download and run `clara-ns-ex.core`, it will run a simple query, but it will pull rules from one namespace, queries from another, and facts from yet a third namespace.
